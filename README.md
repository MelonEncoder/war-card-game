# War Card Game
This is a simple iOS project aimed at learning the basics of mobile development using Swift and SwiftUI.

The idea for this project comes from a YouTube tutorial by @CodeWithChris called "How to Make an App." I used the tutorial as reference to get a hang of how things worked. This project exceeds the scope of the tutorial, with the current logic being an exact simulation of the war card game. 

# Assets
The assets are from his "How to Make an App" tutorial series. I did end up modifying the button texture, so it won't be the same as displayed in his videos.
