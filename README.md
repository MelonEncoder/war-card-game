# War Card Game
This is a simple iOS project aimed at learning the basics of mobile development using Swift and SwiftUI.

The idea for this project comes from a YouTube tutorial by @CodeWithChris called "How to Make an App." I used the tutorial as reference to get a hang of how things worked. This project exceeds the scope of the tutorial, with the current logic being an exact simulation of the war card game.

# Gameplay
To play your card you just have to **tap** on the screen. Whom ever played the higher card gets to take both cards played. If the cards are of equal value, then both players lay three cards face down (offerings) and then place a fourth card down. Same logic as before, whoever has the higher card takes all the cards in play. The person who captures all the cards in the deck wins the game. Aces are of higher value than kings.

# Assets
The assets are from CodeWithChris's "How to Make an App" tutorial series. I modifying the button texture, so it won't be the same as displayed in his videos.
