# War Card Game
This is a simple iOS project aimed at learning the basics of mobile development and the SwiftUI library.

The assets are pulled from @CodeWithChris on Youtube from his "How to Make an App" tutorial series. I did modify the button texture, so it won't be the same as showcased in the video.

This project was modified to deviate from the tutorial. I am adding more content and rearranging the layout.
